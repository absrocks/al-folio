Hello, I am currently working as a Research Computing Facilitator at [NJIT](https://njit.edu) [High Performance Computing](https://hpc.njit.edu). I specialize in HPC software installation and the management of large-scale computational environments, with a strong emphasis on system health monitoring, software debugging, and performance optimization.

I am a computational fluid dynamics scientist by training. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://hpc.njit.edu) under the supervision of Dr. [Simone Marras](https://web.njit.edu/~smarras/). My primary research focus includes geophysical flows, large eddy simulation (LES), fluid–structure interaction (FSI), and computational heat transfer, with an emphasis on high-performance computing–based simulations.
