Hello, I am a Research Computing Facilitator at [NJIT](https://njit.edu) [High Performance Computing](https://hpc.njit.edu). I specialize in HPC software installation and the management of large-scale computational environments, with a strong emphasis on system health monitoring, software debugging, and performance optimization.
